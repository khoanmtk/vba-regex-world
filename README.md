## About

This is the tool support for:
- Search with regex in list of file or folder.
- List up result to each cell.

Why you use this tool:

Because VBA sourcecode are inside Excel file (binary file), then I need to use [vbaDeveloper](https://github.com/hilkoc/vbaDeveloper) to import, export and manage VBA source code version
Each time you open or close `vba-regex-world-dev.xlsm` the Excel tool, there will be an diaglog appears add for import and export VBA source.
If you only need to use the tool then you should use `vba-regex-world.xlsm`, this is`vba-regex-world-dev.xlsm` without [vbaDeveloper](https://github.com/hilkoc/vbaDeveloper)
